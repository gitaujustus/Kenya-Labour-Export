# Labor Export System

## Project Description

A comprehensive platform for managing labor export applications, ensuring efficient worker deployment, rights protection, and secure data management. This system aims to streamline the process of labor export from Kenya, providing a centralized solution for all stakeholders involved.

This project is developed as part of senior project requirements for my software engineering degree at the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton.

## Objectives

1. **Skills Matching**: 
    - Ensure that workers are matched with jobs that suit their skills and qualifications.
    - Facilitate better job placement and satisfaction by aligning worker capabilities with employer needs.

2. **Labor Rights Protection**: 
    - Safeguard the rights of workers throughout the application and deployment process.
    - Implement policies and protocols to ensure fair treatment and compliance with labor laws.

3. **Worker Well-being**: 
    - Monitor and support the well-being of workers before, during, and after deployment.
    - Provide resources and assistance to address any issues or concerns that arise.

4. **Data Security**: 
    - Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of all data handled by the system.
    - Implement robust security measures to protect personal and sensitive information.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user login and registration process.
- **Job Posting and Approval**: Employers can post job vacancies and get them approved by the relevant authorities.
- **Application and Matching**: Users can apply for jobs and be matched based on their skills.
- **Status Tracking**: Track the status of applications in real-time.
- **Feedback and Grievance Reporting**: Provide a channel for users to give feedback and report grievances.
- **Emergency Assistance and Support**: Offer support and assistance in case of emergencies.

## Development Tools

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Prisma**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database interaction.
- **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative for database and authentication services.
